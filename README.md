# The-Attention-and-Autoencoder-Hybrid-Learning-Model-
• A mechanism to prolong the prediction time span of the concentration of PM2.5. • A hybrid attention mechanism taking decoder sequence into consideration, paying due attention to data in current time period. • More constraints conducted on the data with longer time span to current time.
